# Description: This script take two text files- command_list.txt and host.txt as input. The host.txt supplies management ip of the routers and command_list.txt supplies the list of command to be collected.
#              The script asks username and password for the router login. 
#              The output of the script collected is stored in seperate file.
#
# Possible improvement with the script: using router name instead of IP, uploading data directly to FTP, asking user 
#              to provide a name of router instead of host file, multi-processing so that script collect output on multiple routers simulteneously, exception handling so that script logs the error of connecting with device and move on with next one.
